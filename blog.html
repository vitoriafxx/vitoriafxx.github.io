<h3>Frustrations, past and Backbone</h3>
  <p>over the past few days i've been dealing with a bunch of stuff i never thought i would have to deal with, responsibilities i wasn't exactly ready to have, stressful situations that caused me to breakdown into small panic attacks hidden in my room, somtimes i don't feel fit for the situation i'm in, but there's nothing i can do about it now, except try my hardest to keep my sanity and try to make things work out, money is my biggest obstacle right now, i can't seem to find out how to make enough money for the expenses i have right now. I've been working on a game, i'll release it for free, both for android and windows, it's a game about me, about my past, my memories, i'm in a lot of pain and the way i found out how to get this all off my chest is to work on that game, is to put all my emotions into that game, the game is complete mess, full of dialogues and zero action,  but if you're not a fan of reading, what you're doing here then?</p>
  <p>i keep remembering moments where i was happy with someone i can't see or talk with anymore, they hurt, but i'll leave that to the game.</p>
